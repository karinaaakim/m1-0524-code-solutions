## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  a tool that performs a task or calculates a value w/ a given input (parameter) that returns an output

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  function keyword, function name, (parameters, :, parameter type,) function type, opening curly brace, code, optional return statement, closing curly brace

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  function name, in parenthesis are the arguments being passed in

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  the definition stores the code that the function will perform, the call is inserting an input which the function will perform & then give an output

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  parameters are placeholders set while the function is being defined & arguments are inputs that will be passed into the function to get an output

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  parameters are placeholders in functions for arguments to be passed in later

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?

  1. causes the function to produce an output value
  2. prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  variable keyword, function name, = (assignment operator), parameter: parameter type in parenthesis, :, function type, => (fat arrow), {, only 1 line of code, }

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  it has an implicit return, which means that an arrow function can return a value without using the return keyword
